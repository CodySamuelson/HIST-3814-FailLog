# Exercise 7:

- Opened RAW, copy and pasted cvs of Texan Corespondance and got "Whoops! 20"
- Opened [Google Sheets](https://www.google.ca/sheets/about/), and opened a new Google Sheet.
- Typed: =IMPORTDATA("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hist3907b-winter2015/module4-holes/master/texas.csv") into the top left cell and ans entire sheet filled with Texas correspondence data!
- I hovered over b2 cell, and pressed shift+ctrl+downarrow, and then shitf+crtl+rightarrow. I then copied all of that data and under 'Edit' selected 'paste special' -> 'paste VALUES only'.
- I then cleaned up the data using the Blank Detector add on. The data should be ready for RAW!
- Successfully parsed 759 records. I used Alluvial, but the data is still messy. I have clean data from Module 3 in Github, I'll try using that instead.
- Created a [cool graph](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/hist3814o/blob/master/TexasCorrespondance(Alluvial).png) using Source and Target as variables! It's interesting to see who spoke the most with whom, in my opinion anyways. As it turns out, Ashbel Smith and Anson Jones had the most correspondence.
- Still not as useful as the other data though, which had more information. I don't think the blank detector add on was working, so I will ask in Slack for help.
- Have not heard back from anyone and about to leave WiFi for the rest of the day, will have to speak to the professor about it later this week!

# Exercise 8:

- Grabbed a detailed [map](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/2osa8m/very_detailed_map_of_the_roman_empire_in_the_year/) of the Ancient Roman Empire (211 AD).
- Signed up for WorldMap Warp. Added metadata, and uploaded the map!
- Using an ancient map probably won't work :(. Now to find a more modern map.
- Selected a map of London in 1806. Error message, will try again later...
- OK finally uploaded. Rectified as well!
- Opened in KML (Google Maps) SO COOL. Tile URL is: http://warp.worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/tile/6467/z/x/y.png
- Followed the professor's tutorial and [successfully merged the map!](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/hist3814o/blob/master/Palladio%20Map.png) Really useful tool.

# Moving Forward
I'm hoping to incorporate the tools I've gained from these exercises into my final project. As of now I want to create a visually rich data visualization that can represent something along the lines of the popularity of specific words, concepts, or things. An interesting study would be to document the use 
of "London", or "British" in a postive or negative context, and draw a conclusion based on loyalist sympathies throughout the years, or something. Either way, I'm happy with the exercises I chose this week, and looking forward to making some use out of them!
