# Final Project: An Analysis on Quebec thoughts on Empire using data visualization
## Introduction
Final project time! My goal is to discover to what degree did turn of the 20th century west quebecers regard themselves as part of Empire? To do this, I will use wget to pull clippings from 1901-1911. Then, I will use Open Refine to clean up the text, and then a data visualization program to communicate the frequency the words "London", "Unitied Kingdom", "Great Britain", or "Empire" were mentioned per year. Considering the proposed points offered by professor James Kennedy in his text, _Liberal Nationalisms: Empire, State, and Civil Society in Scotland and Quebec_, many Quebecers did not necessarily see themselves as a part of the British Empire at the turn of the 20th century. As such, revewing the frequency of these key terms can be used as a measure to determine how accurate this point really is. If the words "London", and "Empire" are mentioned frequently in the _Shawville Equity_, then perhaps Quebecers were more invested in the British Empire than many scholars have suggested. In either case, the following analysis and subsequent presentation of data using digital visualisation will offer important insight into to what degree did turn of the 20th century west quebecers regard themselves as part of Empire.

It is important to note that the data captured or "taken" in this project is not being measured in a comprehensive fashion meant to capture the context behind the key terms. Rather, the thesis an conclusions put forth from this study will merely be used as an interpretation based on the frequency of the key terms int he given timeline. A more in-depth analysis surrounding the context of the key terms would be useful in rounding out this study and used to make more definitive conclusions.

## Getting Started
- First, I have to re-learn all of this stuff. I made a new account in DHbox, and am re-watching the professor's video on how to use wget.
- Starting to download years 1901 - 1911 one year at a time using this line of code: *'wget http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1884/ -A .txt -r --no-parent -nd â€“w 2 --limit-rate=200k'*. I am just changing the *year* each time. Might have to spend the whole day just gathering the required data.
- All done! I checked off all of the files located in my file manager and started to download them. Not sure if this is the most efficient way to do things.
- Ran into a little problem. I opened all of my 1901 txt files in Notepad++ but there are a lot, and they are all seperate. I need to find a way to merge all of the text into a single file covering all of the text in 1901.
- Now that I have each file seperated by year in DHbox, I am having trouble trying to download these files onto my own computer so I can open them in Notepad++.
