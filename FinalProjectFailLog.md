# Final Project: An Analysis on Quebecois thoughts concerning nationalism and the British Empire using data visualization
## Introduction
Final project time! My goal is to discover to what degree did turn of the 20th century west Quebecois regard themselves as part of British Empire. To do this, I will use wget to pull clippings from 1901-1911. Then, I will use Open Refine to clean up the text, and then a data visualization program to communicate the frequency the words "London", "United Kingdom", "Great Britain", or "Empire" were mentioned per year. Considering the proposed points offered by professor James Kennedy in his text, _Liberal Nationalisms: Empire, State, and Civil Society in Scotland and Quebec_, many Quebecois did not necessarily see themselves as a part of the British Empire at the turn of the 20th century. (Kennedy:2015) As such, reviewing the frequency of these key terms can be used as a measure to determine how accurate this point really is. If the words "London", and "Empire" are mentioned frequently in the _Shawville Equity_, then perhaps the Quebecois were more invested in the British Empire than many scholars have suggested. In either case, the following analysis and subsequent presentation of data using digital visualisation will offer important insight into self-identity and nationalism in Quebec at the turn of the 20th century. This project will try to prove that, in line with the historical viewpoint, that Quebecois at the turn of the 20th century did not necessarily view themselves as part of the British Empire, which will be outlined using data-visualisation to highlight the lack of frequency in specific key terms. 
## Contextualizing this Project
It is important to note that the data captured or "taken" in this project is not being measured in a comprehensive fashion meant to capture the context behind the key terms. Rather, the thesis and conclusions put forth from this study will merely be used as an interpretation based on the frequency of the key terms in the given timeline. A more in-depth analysis surrounding the context of the key terms would be useful in rounding out this study and used to make more definitive conclusions.

Additionally, there is the ethics standpoint that must be considered before starting this project. It is interesting that such a small and uncontextualized data-set (in this case choosing keywords) and then using the power of visual statistics to make a broad claim (to what degree did turn of the 20th century west Quebecois regard themselves as part of Empire) is, quite frankly, scary. We will never know why or why not certain key terms were used, and even if their frequency of use truly reflects their thoughts and feelings of the British Empire. The mere fact that such claims can be made and "proved" using the following data methods presents a strong argument for the need for constant fact-checking and contextualization when data-visualization is used in an effort to prove or promote a "fact". 

## Getting Started - Organizing Data
- First, I have to re-learn all of this stuff. I made a new account in DHbox, and am re-watching the professor's video on how to use wget.
- Starting to download years 1901 - 1911 one year at a time using this line of code: *'wget http://collections.banq.qc.ca:8008/jrn03/equity/src/1884/ -A .txt -r --no-parent -nd â€“w 2 --limit-rate=200k'*. I am just changing the *year* each time. Might have to spend the whole day just gathering the required data.
- All done! I checked off all of the files located in my file manager and started to download them. Not sure if this is the most efficient way to do things.
- Ran into a little problem. I opened all of my 1901 txt files in Notepad++ but there are a lot, and they are all separate. I need to find a way to merge all of the text into a single file covering all of the text in 1901.
- Now that I have each file separated by year in DHbox, I am having trouble trying to download these files onto my own computer so I can open them in Notepad++.
- Professor suggested to Google 'concatenate text files terminal'. The suggested path is using the following line of code: cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt. 'cat' Signals to the terminal that you want to combine the files, with the names of the files being specified. The _output redirection symbol_ (>) is used to create a new file with the combined text, rather than just having it all appear on the terminal.
- Just manually copied and set up the names of files using the same line of code (took a long time, I should find a better way to do this), and about to try it!
- AND IT DID NOT WORK. Instead stated that it cannot find my files........ I tried to google the issue but have not found any answers yet. Reached out on Slack.
- Ok, I tried opening the folder containing all of the text files (1901) using _cd 1901_. However, when I tried to use the cat line of code again, this time it says that I am _denied permission_. 
- Professor suggested using _sudo_ before _cat_. Tried but still did not work.
- Tried combining all files into _> fred.txt_ since that file name didn't exist yet. Did not work.
- Jeffblackadar is helping on Slack. Suggested _sudo bash -c :cat.... >fred.txt"_. Did not work.
- Jeffblackadar suggested trying _$ sudo bash -c "cat *1901*>1901all.txt"_ to simplify the process. Did not work.
- A file called "_fred.txt_" is being created but it is always empty. Neither of us is sure why.
- Turns out I can open all of the files at once in Open Refine! I will import all of the files in a given year, and then export to a cvs file.
- I ended up exporting it into Notepad++ in order to clean the text up. I wanted to find and delete any lines in all of the 1901 txt files that didn't contain the word "_London_". To do this, I Searched and found some help on Stackoverflow. 

1) First, I went to the Search menu > Find... > Select "Mark" Tab. Activate regular expressions. Search for London. Don't forget to check "Bookmark lines" and Press "Mark All". All the rows I wanted to keep got a bookmark
2) Went to Menu "Search - Bookmark - Inverse Bookmark". All of the lines I wanted to delete were then bookmarked. 
3) Finally, went to Menu "Search - Bookmark - Remove Bookmarked lines". This deleted all of the unwanted bookmarked lines.
 
 - OK. So now I have a document that contains all of the lines with the word "_London_" that were written in 1901 in the Shawville Equity. Now I'm getting somewhere.
 - I cleaned up the text a bit in Notepad++ just by deleting some blank spaces. Now I will move on to Open Refine to transform into a strong cvs document. I then deleted the all of the content contained in each line except for each date. I now have a list of years, with each year in the table being an instance where the word "London" was used. For example, if I have 202 instances of 1905 in my document, this means that the word "London" appeared 202 times in the 1905 edition of the _Shawville Equity_.
 - Now to duplicate the process for the other years. The final cvs document containing the data can be found [here](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/FinalProjectHIST3814o/blob/master/London(1901-1911).cvs.csv).
## Data Visualization
- Tried to plug data into [RAW](http://rawgraphs.io/), but did not respond correctly. Tried creating a header called _Date_ above each of the columns containing years. This did not work.
- Hmmmm, maybe I'll try to put _Date: Year_ in the top of each column. This did not work either. Time to reach out in Slack!
- It has occurred to me that I will only be able to look for the word "London" in this visualization. However, if I had a lot more time, I would be able to repeat these steps using different key words, such as "Britain" and "Empire".
- Professor responded on Slack! Sent this [link](https://librecatproject.wordpress.com/2014/12/04/day-4-grep-less-and-wc/amp/), I'll look into it.
- Ah, it was on how to get the count number of a specific word. While this is very useful for my project, it doesn't necessarily help me figure out how to properly visualize my data set in RAW. 
- However, it did give me an idea in terms of another way to visualize my data. Unfortuanely I think I made a lot of steps that I did not need to. Turns out I can just search for the number of times specific key terms are mentioned by year, and then write down the exact amount per year. This creates a much more simple data-set, as well as one that is much easier to visualize. The new data-set along with the graph that I made through excel can be found [here](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/FinalProjectHIST3814o/blob/master/Times%20London%20Was%20Mentioned.xlsx). Using this efficient form of counting for key terms, I should actually be able to find more than just the term "London" before the project is due! Now to try and make the data-visualization slightly more presentable.
## Presentation
- I need to present these findings to other historians who might want to use the data. As such, I need to find a graph that can, at a glance, be both accurate in terms of numbers as well as visually appealing enough to capture attention. I will use [Inkspace](https://inkscape.org/en/release/0.92.2/) to make the presentation of my data more visually appealing.
- In all honesty, the graph provided by Excel is quite good, and after looking through Inkspace, I couldn't really find many ways to improve it. However, again going through these steps gave me an idea. Instead of looking for more key terms like "Britain" and "Empire", which would essentially just tell me the same thing as "London", why not look up "Quebec" as a key term? I could then compare that to the term "London", and the resulting relationship would do more to describe Quebec nationalism at the turn of the 20th century.
- SO, I re-did the process, only this time I was looking for "Quebec" as a key term rather than "London". Lucky this time went much faster. The new data-set can be found [here](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/FinalProjectHIST3814o/blob/master/Times%20London%20Was%20Mentioned%20Versus%20Quebec.xlsx).
- And this is interesting! As it turns out, London was actually mentioned more often than Quebec! This research shows that the Quebecois in Shawville might have been more strongly linked to the British Empire than some historians like James Kennedy had proposed.
- Now to create the graph! In all honesty, I found that the most useful and easily-read graph was the one already included in Excel. I imagine that most of the indivuduals viewing this work might only have a small amount of experience using digital tools, and so the simple, straightforward and accurate graph should do the trick. 

![Excel Graph](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/FinalProjectHIST3814o/blob/master/Excel%20Graph.png)

- As you can see, "Quebec" was mentioned less than "London" every year except for 1908.
## Conclusion:
In an effort to find to what extent Quebecois saw themselves as a part of the British Empire at the turn of the 20th century, I examined the frequency of the words "London" and "Quebec" in the Shawville Equity from 1901-1911. To do this, I used wget to pull clippings from 1901-1911. Then, I used Open Refine concatenate all of the files into single documents seperated by year. I then used Notepad++ to locate and seperate every use of the key terms from the rest of the text, and exported it to a cvs file. With this, I was able to create a graph that used data-visualization to showcase a simple and accurate depiction of the key terms per year. I looked at the argument offered by professor James Kennedy in his text, _Liberal Nationalisms: Empire, State, and Civil Society in Scotland and Quebec_, that many Quebecois did not necessarily see themselves as a part of the British Empire at the turn of the 20th century.(Kennedy:2015) I believed that this project would prove that, in line with the historical viewpoint, that Quebecers did not necessarily view themsleves as part of the British Empire at the turn of the 20th century. However, contrary to my initial claim, the term "Londnon" appeared more frequently than the term "Quebec" every year except for 1908. Although my findings do not communicate the context behind each use of the key terms, the analysis does indicate that contrary to the argument proposed by myself and James Kennedy, Quebecois did indeed see themselves and the British Empire as very close, as can be seen by the frequency of the use of the word "London" when compared to the use of the word "Quebec".

# My Growth as a Digital Historian
### Narrativity:
In terms of this final project, I identified an important story - namely Quebec nationalism at the turn of the 20th century - and attempted to locate and describe changes over the course of a decade. In the middle of the project, I realised that the narrative of only looking at key terms that had to do with the British Empire was insufficient for this narrative, and so I made the dewcision to look at "Quebec" as a key term as well. Having the confidence and ability to do this reoresents my growth to see that my initial thesis was not sufficient, and that in order to better explain the narrative at hand, I needed to change it.
### Evidence: 
My evidence through FailLogs has grown exponentially. My [first FailLog](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/HIST-3814-FailLog/blob/master/Startingover_June12) was a world away from the one I am currently writing. It was extremly short, with no narrative or real evidence to speak of. It was poorly organised, with no headings, paragraphs, or even proper sentences. Additionally, I was not even able to turn it into proper Markdown syntax. My FailLogs, and therefore my evidence, became stronger with every passing week. I now pay attention to format, include important code, input links, use Markdown correctly, and even input images. All of these tools serve as a means to strengthen my open-notebook and translate into a much more effective medium for presenting evidence.
### Empathy:
I included a section before starting this project on the ethical implications of the study I was about to do. This was not something I would have thought about at the start of this class. Realising that digital-history and the ability tio grab and manipulate massive swaths of data comes with the responsibility for the researcher to recognize the _why_ of the results, and include these thoughts throughout the process of the project. 
### Style:
My written process has progressed from [short, and frankly bad blog posts](http://contextualizinghistory.com/uncategorized/what-is-digital-history-for-me-anyway/) that not only improperly tried to communicate an annotation I had made, to [complex and comprehensive posts](http://contextualizinghistory.com/uncategorized/pros-and-cons-of-data-visualization/) that not only examined the readings and my own thoughts, but engaged with the thoughts and ideas of my peers as well.
### Self-Reflection:
Throughout this course and specifically throughout this final project, I have been painfully aware of my technological limitations. 
When I started the course, I could not even link to an annotation, much less use wget code to pull data and then a tool like Open Refine to organize and present it. However, I was wiling to meet with the professor almost every wekk in person and ask for help constantly on Slack in an effort to make up for my own technological disabilities. As a result, this final project and analysis may have been conducted in one of the least-efficient ways imagineable, but I was able to complete it by not giving up, asking for help, and being willing to change the direction of my study.
### Value 'fail':
I have failed many times in this course. In my [Module2 FailLog](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/HIST-3814-FailLog/blob/master/Module2June23.md) I was only able to properly complete one of the exercises. However, I used many of the techniques that I was unable to complete in Module 2 during this project, and I was able to complete it. If you have read each of my steps during this project, just be aware that some of the fails (specifically trying to concatenate the files) took me days to figure out. However, I simply reached out through Slack, or tried entirely different ways of looking at the problem to make productive use of these failures, and move forward. In fact, it was as a result of my own failures in this project that I was able to take a step back, and realize that my initial thesis was not the best question to ask, so I asked a different one instead. Through my failures, this project evolved to have a much stronger and well-balanced argument. 
### Reproducibility:
Again, after looking at my [first FailLog](https://github.com/CodySamuelson/HIST-3814-FailLog/blob/master/Startingover_June12), I did not explain anything to the extent that others reading it could have understood and copied what I was trying to do. Yes I was trying to set up my space and tools as a digital historian, but I failed to include links, explanations, or evidence of my work at all. This final project and the fact that I wrote down step-by-step examples, inlcuded links, lines of code, and images, all point to producing work with evidence that makes it much easier to reproduce for other digital historians. 
### Collegiality:
I would not have been able to complete this project, or this course, without Slack. I asked numerous questions every week, regardless of how dumb they might have been, and the class was excellent enough to try and help. For example, without Jeffblackadar going over this project with me for hours, I might never have been able to figure out how to concatenate my files. Additionally, every week I tried more and more to engage with others in the class through our [annotations](http://jonudell.net/h/facet.html?facet=user&mode=documents&search=csamuelson) on the readings. As a result, my understanding and appreciattion for the content we were learning was much higher than it would have otherwise been.
## Closing Statement
And so, you have finally made it to the end of this massive FailLog. Through it, you would have seen the process of me coming up with an idea, attempting it, failing to execute it, change it, fail at it again, only to finally complete it and form an arguement that was enhanced through the tools and skills I learned as a digital historian. I tried to emphasize my growth throughout this class, and I hope that in addition to the points I made, that you look back at old submissions I made on [Github](https://github.com/CodySamuelson) and see with your own eyes how far I was able to progress. This course has been one of the most challenging in my university career, but also the most rewarding. I actually had fun on this final project, and ended up learning more than I thought was possible. I hope to continue to develop the skills and ideals that I have learned in this class, and to progress and evolve as a digital historian throughout the rest of my academic career.
