Spoke with Dr. Graham today, have a lot to learn about HIST3814. Need to integrate slack, github, DHbox, and wordpress into my daily life;
Learn to share ideas, engage with other students, and be up-front about the issues i'm having in the class;
ANNOTATE EVERYTHING;
Course is based on how far an individual is able to progress - at least I have a lot of room for improvement;
Now to make a super cool blog post.
